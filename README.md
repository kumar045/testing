 <!--::page{title="__Task 8:__ (Optional) Deploy the application on IBM Cloud."}

>Note : This will only work if Cloud Foundry is available.

1. Change to the `final_project` directory.

    ```
    cd /home/projects/xzceb-flask_eng_fr/final_project
    ```
    

2. Login to the ibmcloud with your email and enter your password when prompted.

    ```
    ibmcloud login -u <your email>
    ```
    

3. Set the target region and owner. Run the followinf command after you  replace `REGION` with your region and the `OWNER` with your email id.

    ```
    ibmcloud target --cf-api https://api.REGION.cf.cloud.ibm.com -r REGION -o OWNER
    ```
    

4. Create an account space called `translator`.

    ```
    ibmcloud account space-create translator
    ```
    

5. Target the account space you just created.

    ```
    ibmcloud target -s translator
    ```
    

6. Replace line 3 in the `manifest.yml` to give a name for your web application.

7. Deploy the application.

    ```
    ibmcloud app push
    ```
    

8. The route for your web application will be printed on the screen. Copy it to connect to it after the application successfully deploys.

    <img src="images/deploy_app.png" style="margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px"/>

    >Troubleshoot: You can check the logs by running, `ibmcloud cf logs <appname> --recent`

9. You can see your deployed application listed in the [Cloud Foundry](https://cloud.ibm.com/cloudfoundry/public). To make changes and push your app again, stop and delete the application from [Cloud Foundry](https://cloud.ibm.com/cloudfoundry/public) and then execute `ibmcloud app push`. -->



::page{title="__Task 8:__ Deploy the application on Code Engine."}

1. Change to the `final_project` directory.

    ```
    cd /home/project/xzceb-flask_eng_fr/final_project
    ```
  > ### Note: 
  > - Make sure `Task 7: Run the servers` runs successfully.
  > - In `requirements.txt` file, delete the package versions and it should look as shown below:
  ![](/images/Image.png)
  

2. Letâ€™s create a Dockerfile in your project directory. Dockerfile is the blueprint for building a container image for our app. 
    
  ![](/images/Image%201.png)



3. Create `Dockerfile` and add the following lines to your file:

    ```
    FROM python:alpine3.7
    COPY . /app
    WORKDIR /app
    RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
    EXPOSE 8080
    ENTRYPOINT [ "python" ]
    CMD [ "server.py" ]
    ```

  On the first line we are importing the Docker image `python:alpine3.7` which comes with support for Python 3. This image allows us to create Flask web applications in Python that run in a single container. We are interested in the latest version of this image available, which supports Python 3.

  On the next 2 lines, we are opening port 8080 to usage in the docker container. This will allow us to access our application later once itâ€™s deployed to the cloud.

  Finally, we copy the contents of the final_project directory we just created, into an app directory in the container image. Pretty easy, right!

  You should have a directory structure like this:
   
  ![](/images/Image%202.png)
 

4. On the menu in your lab environment, click `Skills network tools`; Click Cloud dropdown and choose `Code Engine`. The code engine set up panel comes up. Click `Create Project`.

 ![](/images/Image%203.png)

    

5. The code engine environment takes a while to prepare. You will see the progress status being indicated in the set up panel.


6. Once the code engine set up is complete, you can see that it is active. Click on `Code Engine CLI` to begin the pre-configured CLI in the terminal below.

   ![](/images/Image%204.png)

You will now use the CLI to deploy the application.

7. Change to the app directory where the Dockerfile was created.


    ```
    cd /home/project/xzceb-flask_eng_fr/final_project
    ```

8. Now run `docker build` in the app directory and tag the image. Note that in the below command we are naming the app `flask-docker-demo-translator`.

    ```
    docker build . -t us.icr.io/${SN_ICR_NAMESPACE}/flask-docker-demo-translator
    
    ```
   ![](/images/Image%205.png)

9. Now push the image to the namespace so that you can run it.

    ```
    docker push us.icr.io/${SN_ICR_NAMESPACE}/flask-docker-demo-translator:latest
    ```
    ![](/images/Image%206.png)

10. Deploy the application.

    ```
    ibmcloud ce application create --name flask-docker-demo-translator --image us.icr.io/${SN_ICR_NAMESPACE}/flask-docker-demo-translator --registry-secret icr-secret

    ```
   ![](/images/Image%207.png)

> Please note this command will run only in a Code Engine CLI. If you didnâ€™t follow the steps 4 to 7 to start the Code Engine CLI, you may get errors.

11. Press ctrl(Windows)/cmd(Mac) and the link that is created. Alternatively copy the link and paste it in a browser page and press enter. The `flask-docker-demo-translator` application page renders as given below.
